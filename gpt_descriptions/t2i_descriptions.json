Fog is also typically associated with high humidity, dews, and often appears in the morning or evening in cooler temperatures.",
            "One way to identify fog is by its visual appearance - it looks like a cloud reaching the ground level, reducing visibility significantly. Additionally, another key identifier is that fog usually occurs in the morning or late at night and is predominantly seen in areas with bodies of water, valleys, and after rainfall due to high humidity. Measuring visibility could also help: if it is less than 1",
